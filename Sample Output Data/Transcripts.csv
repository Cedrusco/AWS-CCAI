i m i m sorry i so you re a manager from beast with? yes my name is  pii . okay. um okay so our cobra ended our cobra benefits ended on um 10 22 20, that was our 18 months of eye and dental. mhm. and um well first of all they had sent, i know where we mailed the um payments, um started going to different places, but i ve called several times and they keep telling me they can t see our account and they can t see our payments. but i sent in the correent payment for october, which was a prorated amount that i was given with the old statements of 29 37. and i sent that in and then i got a bill stating that we didn t pay 12 01 of october. well october was prorated, it shouldn t have been 41 37 it was 29 37, which i did pay. so i called and said i shouldn t have been billed for $12 for october because we didn t have the coverage from october 22 until october 31. so i called and talked to  pii  and she said, well i can t see that you paid the payment, but i did the end of september our check cleared the bank and um she said she was gonna take care of it. and then you turned around this week again and build us for 29 37 for the prorated amount of october i had paid that amount a month ago. so what i was trying to do is i just want them to realize that our account is paid and it should be closed because they keep billing us and it s it s over our 18 months is over, okay and i definitely understand. i remember i do apologize for the inconvenience, i do show that our um our team is actually trying to confirm that um on the back end, as far as that your account is paid to the last day of coverage. um it does show that the the cobra coverage has ended. so i do have an end date of october 20 seconds, but since the cobra has ended, we have to actually do a little bit more research on the back end to confirm that payment and the last day of coverage being paid up until that date because of the fact that the cobra account is closed now. so um our team is working on that as soon as they have confirmation from our billing team that his payment is paid through the last day of coverage and that there s no additional funds of um that s due on his account that we are going to give a call back once again. but we are in the works of looking into that for you, because how can i, like i talked to the billing department several times and they say that they can t see our account and even when it was open, like they re telling me well we can t see it now because it s closed. but even when i called a month in a month or two ago, when our account was open, they kept telling me there was a glitch on our account that they couldn t see any of our payments now, you know that that that is an um unfortunately uh issue that some of our company members, um the accounts where sometimes when we try to go into the billing information, it doesn t display and we have to actually have someone in our back office to verify the information. so that is something that is known that we are working on. but in the meantime, as far as like i said, this particular issue, we are still having them to look into that for you. okay, i mean because i have the, i have the cancelled payment in my checking account and everything. i mailed out the october payment, like 25 september i know it s paid, i just want, i just want to be swift to send me a statement that it s paid and closed out. so they stop sending me bills. like i got a bill to pay 29, this week dated october 20 and it was like, i paid you a month ago you re right. i understand that. i mean that s because the bill know that um just as far as the billing hasn t caught up with the fact that the account is closed, because the the bills do automatically generate by the system. so i said once we have that confirmation, you won t have to worry about getting any additional bills that will, you know, be closed out in the building will stop once it s confirmed that that payment has posted, include out the account. if we need any additional information, you know, from you will definitely let you know, but you ve already confirmed that you paid it is paid and you paid it, you know, at the end of september, so there shouldn t be any additional issue. we just have to have our team to confirm that as well. okay, well will they send a statement then that this account is closed? i can definitely put that in the request, um, that another statement goes, um, goes out to show that there is a zero balance, but like i said, they do go out systematically, i don t know of another statement will you can go out next month because the account is closed and the billing only generates once a month, so they generated around the 15th of every month. so since he won t have any coverage, no anymore, it probably won t go out, but i can definitely see if they can send out one final bill to show the account does have a zero balance. okay, so so you can see that our account has a zero balance though, right, i can t see the billing anymore. that s what i m saying, our team is looking on the back end doesn t show me any bill anymore because the the corporate account is closed. so that s what our billing team is looking into that on the back end. okay, so i just, i mean i just, i wanna make sure i mean i know i pay it a month in advance so october was paid in september but they just keep sending us bills. so i just wanna make sure that be swift closes out our account because we re done with them. i definitely spend 100% accent in our billing team is working accent. um as soon as we have that confirmation that definitely we re gonna give you a call back once again to confirm everything that was located on the account. okay. okay. alright so can i do apologize for any inconvenience but we ll definitely be getting back with you here so is there any other questions i m able to answer for you at this time? uh nope i just i just wanted the billing to stop so it doesn t keep showing like we re overdue on a bill for our credit. i understand. yeah i m not definitely um i m definitely gonna let the team know. i say it won t affect his credit as far as like talking about like credit like credit bureaus and things like that that won t be affected at all about this but we definitely will make sure that we get everything cleared up on our end, okay? because we know it s paid and it s closed. we re just trying to get a right on your end. exactly. okay i will wait to hear back. thank you so much ma am for your time and taking my call and your patience. i hope you enjoy the rest of your day. thank you you as well. thank you. bye. bye now. why you.",NEUTRAL,Call Completed
